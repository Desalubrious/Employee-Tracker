# Employee Tracker

## Introduction

> I was tasked with creating an app so that company management could keep track of employees in their database. 
>Employees can be updated, added, deleted, etc.

## Code Samples

``` 
Functional application.


GitHub repository with a unique name and a README describing the project.


The command-line application should allow users to:


Add departments, roles, employees


View departments, roles, employees


Update employee roles```

## Installation

>Clone the repo, then edit the connection for your username and password. Using a .env variable is good, but you would need to install extra packages.
